					Beautiful, easy-to-use websites aren’t always easy to create. With [Wil], the team will work with you to craft an effective website that’s both easy on the eyes and easy on your wallet. Your website will look gorgeous on all types of devices, thanks to our skills with modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation. Dynamic data visualization is a snap with D3, while other JavaScript libraries like jQuery, Underscore, and Angular make your website wow.</p>

			<h1>Painless Backend</h1>
			<p class="two">Isn’t it nice when something works straight out of the box? We think so too. [Wil] makes the tough stuff easy by using a full JavaScript stack. Our experience with Node and Hapi means we build web applications that are lean, reliable, and incredibly fast. When your site gets popular, MongoDB provides the scalability to grow seamlessly along with your userbase. We use hosting sites like Heroku to automatically provide more power when the going gets tough. And in the end, you can focus on business, not maintaining the servers.</p>

			<h1>Write tests. Pass Tests. Fly.</h1>
			<p>We start all our projects by writing tests, which we run after every new piece of work to ensure we’re always focused on building the product you want. Once everything passes, it’s launch time. This agile approach is the best way to provide you with quality assurance as well as the ability to quickly assess future changes. We’re happy writing tests using frameworks like Mocha and Phantom and libraries including Chai, Casper and SuperTest.</p>
