			<h2>Our Model</h2>
			<p>The course's self-funding model will have two main streams of income: renting workspace to our graduates (and other developers), and sponsorship from companies who wish to employ them. The Indiegogo campaign we are running will cover the first three months rent to allow graduates to develop themselves professionally. After that, they will be able to fund the space themselves while volunteering time to help teach the next course.</p>
			<!--This allows alumni to enhance their practices and product ideas while surrounded by other developers-->
